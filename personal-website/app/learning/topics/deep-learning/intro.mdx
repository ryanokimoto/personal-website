# Intro to Deep Learning
In this section we will cover the basics to deep learning, in the broader scope we
can put deep learning as a subsection of machine learning, which itself is a subsection of artificial intelligence.

# What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning for our purposes can be broken down into 3 main categories:

## Supervised Learning
Where we work with labeled data and train a model that maps inputs to outputs that 
either predicts, or classifies unseen data.

Problem Setting: We are given data in pairs: inputs x and outputs y

| x | y | 
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 9 |
| 4 | 16 |
| 5 | ? |
Now we can create some function y that maps the input x to the output y.
For our example we can see that y = x<sup>2</sup>


## Unsupervised Learning
Where we work with unlabeled data and work to find a structure or pattern. Examples of
this would look like clustering or dimensionality reduction

## Reinforcement Learning
Where we develop an agent that works in an environment to find actions that can
decrease the cost or increase the reward given to it.
